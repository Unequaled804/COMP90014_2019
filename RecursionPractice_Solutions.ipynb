    "Both approaches achieve the same thing. The main purpose here for using recursion is that once you understand it, it will be much easier to read. The iterative apporach can sometimes be faster but the simplicity is sometimes preferred. \n",

    "**Beware of infinite loops**, this occurs when the function keeps calling itself and never ends.\n",

    "You could do it recursively:\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "    def countdown(i):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "        countdown(i-1)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "However since you never told the program to end it will continue counting down forever.\n",
    "A recursive function always has to say when to stop repeating itself. **There should always be two parts to a recursive function: the recursive case and the base case.** The recursive case is when the function calls itself. The base case is when the function stops calling itself. This prevents infinite loops.\n",
